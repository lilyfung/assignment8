From the histograms of 2007 to 2012, we can see that the distributions remained skewed to the left 
throughout these 5 years. 
From the bokplots, we can observe that the medians of every region improved in 2010 from 1970. Also,
the distribution seems to become more dispersed for Asia and Europe, as the quartiles and the maximums
and minumums become larger throughout the decades. This trend indicates that income gaps between nations
are widening in those regions. Lastly, Europe has remained the most affluent region while Africa the 
poorest in these 4 decades.
