Incomes accross the regions appear to be skewed towards lower incomes. While this is 
especially true for both Africa and Asia, it's the opposite case in Europe, where
the median is much closer to the 75th percentile. Over the period from 2007-2012, 
these income gaps largely remain, with the exception of Oceana, which looks to have 
had a large contraction in 2012 with values for the 99th and 75th percentiles much
closer to each other and to the median. 

At the same time, there looks to be an upward movement in median incomes 
in different regions, especially steady in Asia, South America and Africa. 

In addition, looking at the histograms of incomes across counties for a given year
shows that incomes are positively skewed (with the 'long tail' to the positive side), 
and this does not seem to change over this period. Because of this distribution, we 
can say that most countries are in a group of low-income states, btut with a long tail 
of rich states also in existence.
